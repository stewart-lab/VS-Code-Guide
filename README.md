# Step-by-step guide

## Installation
- Navigate to VS Code's download tree â†’ https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
- Open the browser's download list and locate the downloaded app or archive.
- If archive, extract the archive contents. Use double-click for some browsers or select the 'magnifying glass' icon with Safari.
- Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder, making it available in the macOS Launchpad.
- Open VS Code from the Applications folder, by double clicking the icon.
- Add VS Code to your Dock by right-clicking on the icon, located in the Dock, to bring up the context menu and choosing Options, Keep in Dock.

Now would be the time to change the color scheme using the first rectangle of the startup menu. Everything else, however, we will leave for later.


Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.
macOS shell commands

Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.
Note: If you still have the old code alias in your .bash_profile (or equivalent) from an early VS Code version, remove it and replace it by executing the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.




## Establishing Remote Connection

Open a terminal window with the keyboard shortcut (ctrl + `) or by navigating to the terminal drop-down menu 


```

code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
code --install-extension
code --install-extension
code --install-extension
code --install-extension
code --install-extension
code --install-extension
```
