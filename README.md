# Step-by-step guide


Download and install VS Code â†’ https://code.visualstudio.com/Download After completion of the installation prompts, your screen should look like this. Now would be the time to change the color scheme using the first rectangle of the startup menu. Everything else, however, we will leave for later.

Installation#
Download Visual Studio Code for macOS.
Open the browser's download list and locate the downloaded app or archive.
If archive, extract the archive contents. Use double-click for some browsers or select the 'magnifying glass' icon with Safari.
Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder, making it available in the macOS Launchpad.
Open VS Code from the Applications folder, by double clicking the icon.
Add VS Code to your Dock by right-clicking on the icon, located in the Dock, to bring up the context menu and choosing Options, Keep in Dock.
Launching from the command line#
You can also run VS Code from the terminal by typing 'code' after adding it to the path:

Launch VS Code.
Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.
macOS shell commands

Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.
Note: If you still have the old code alias in your .bash_profile (or equivalent) from an early VS Code version, remove it and replace it by executing the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.




## Establishing Remote Connection
